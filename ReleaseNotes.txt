Goblin XNA Release Notes

Version 3.6.0 (7/15/11)


Updates:

1. Added OpenCV 2.1 supports. OpenCVCapture implements IVideoCapture interface using OpenCV, and CvDllBridge,
   CxcoreDllBridge, and HighguiDllBridge classes wrap the OpenCV functions in each dlls. Note that only
   subset of the entire OpenCV libraries are wrapped, and you will need to wrap additional functions youself.
   These wrapper classes are in GoblinXNA.Device.Vision package.

2. Added Tutorial 15 which demonstrates how to use OpenCV with Goblin XNA.

3. Added ResetHistory() interface function to ISmoother.

4. Added StereoCamera.FocalLength property so that the user can adjust the focal length. The focal length
   used to be infinity prior to this version.

5. Added HavokPhysics usage example in Tutorial 5.

6. Added Billboard class in GoblinXNA.Graphics package that extends PrimitiveModel.

7. Added NullCapture usage (which uses a static image for debugging purpose) sample in Tutorial 8.

8. Added CaptureCallback property to PointGreyCapture.


Bug Fixes:

1. Fixed a problem for NullCapture.

2. Fixed marker tracking problem using PointGreyCapture. 


Changes:

1. Resets smoothing history when the marker tracking gets lost in MarkerNode class so that it won't have
   undesirable smoothed jump when the tracking is resumed at different pose. 

2. Same change is made to MarkerBundleNode as above.

3. Overridden MarkerBundleNode's MaxDropouts property so that changes to MarkerBundleNode.MaxDropouts
   will change its supporting node's MaxDropouts properties as well.

4. Updated iWearDllBridge.GetProductID() to return ushort instead of int (it used to be int type, but from
   Vuzix SDK 3.1, it's ushort type), so iWearTracker.ProductID will return correct enum value now.

5. Updated Lidgren.Network to a newer version (gen3 2011-2-19). Updated LidgrenServer and LidgrenClient for this
   update.

6. Moved base.Initialize() call for all of the tutorials to the very beginning of the Initialize() function so that
   LoadContent() is called before initializaing any of the Goblin classes.

7. Moved ImageReadyCallback delegate to IVideoCapture from each implementation and added CaptureCallback 
   property to IVideoCapture interface.

8. Removed animatedMesh parameter from Model's constructor. Instead, added UpdateAnimationTransforms
   method to allow updating the animation transform of a specific mesh (NOTE: This is for Rigid-Body Animation)

9. Made appropriate changes to ModelLoader in accordance with the above change.

10. Made appropriate changes to Tutorial 14's AnimatedModel and AnimatedModelLoader classes in accordance
    with the animatedMesh removal. 

11. Improved the speed for all of the array manipulation methods in ByteHelper class by using Buffer.BlockCopy method
    instead of Array.Copy method. For example, it's 8 times faster to convert 1000000 floats to bytes using 
    ConvertFloatArray compared to previous implementation. This wil enhance the networking speed for large number of
    synchronized geometry nodes.

Version 3.5.1 (1/04/11)


Updates:

1. Updated the user manual to version 3.5.1

2. Added RenderLeftView property to indicate whether the scene graph is currently rendering the left eye view in
   stereo mode. (Note: This property is always true if you're not using stereo mode)


Bug Fixes:

1. Fixed a transformation problem when repeatedly adding and removing a GeometryNode to a physics engine by setting
   GeometryNode.AddToPhysicsEngine to true and false in turns.

2. Fixed model offset problem when IModel.OffsetToOrigin is set to true. It was offseting to the opposite direction.

3. Fixed AABB and CollisionMesh line drawings in AR. I forgot to multiply the marker transforms after changing to
   LineShader based line drawing.

4. Fixed DeviceEnumerator to properly dispose additionalDevices and additional6DOFDevices list when Dispose() is 
   called. 


Changes:

1. Updated SceneGraphDisplay code for line drawing using LineShader. 

2. Modified NewtonPhysics not to redundantly re-calculate the collision shape when only the transform is modified by
   TransformNode (the collision shape is re-calculated if the scaling changes, but not translation or rotation).

3. Updated the frustum culling for stereoscropic view to cull geometries that are outside of each eye independently. 
   It was rendering geometries that are within either eye's view for both eyes before, but it's optimized now.

4. Capitalized the attribute names when saving and loading scene graph nodes. 



Version 3.5 (10/01/10)


Updates:

1. Added a wrapper for ALVAR 1.4.0.

2. Added a wrapper for Havok physics engine (version 710r1), and added HavokPhysics which is an implementation of
   IPhysics in GoblinXNA.Physics.Havok. We only wrapped functionalities that we needed, so if you need additional
   functionalities, you need to wrap yourself.

3. Added CameraCalibration program under /tools directory so that you can calibrate your camera in Goblin XNA now.
   This will remove the need to build ALVAR for calibrating your camera.

4. Added DirectShowCapture2 class which uses another implementation of DirectShowNET. For some reason, DirectShowCapture
   class won't work under 64-bit version since recent Windows update (only tested with Windows 7), so if you're running
   64-bit version and DirectShowCapture won't work, then try to use DirectShowCapture2 class instead.

5. Added VideoBackgroundColor property to Scene class so you can mix a color or change transparency of the
   BackgroundTexture or video image when ShowCameraImage is set to true.

6. Added an easy way to draw a 3D line in the scene by calling State.LineManager.AddLine method. Make sure
   to initialize State.LineManager.LineShader, for example, as follows:

   State.LineManager.LineShader = new Line3DShader("LineRendering.fx");
   State.LineManager.ShaderTechnique = "LineRendering3D";

7. Added EffectHelper class in GoblinXNA.Helpers. 

8. Added support for 2D UI shifting for stereo rendering. Set Scene.GlobalUIShift value, and this shift will be 
   applied to all 2D UI drawings including the text when right eye view is rendered in stereo mode.

9. Added AfterEffectsShader to IModel interface, and now you can added any shaders that renders special effect 
   such as GlowShader. 

10. Added GlowShader under Shaders directory, and also the associated Glow.fx file in data/Shaders folder.

11. Added MarkerBundleNode that extends MarkerNode class and can track dynamically reconfigurable multiple marker arrays.
   (NOTE: This is similar to ALVAR's multiMarkerBundle functionality, but it's not using ALVAR implementation)

12. Added NormalMapShader, NormalMapMaterial, and NormalMap.fx (fx file is under data/Shaders/) for normal map or
    bump map shading.

13. Added GeometryNode.IgnoreDepth property. Please see it's API documentation for details.


Bug Fixes:

1. Fixed the rotational smoothing for DESSmoother (Thanks to Mengu!!)

2. Fixed a problem in SwitchNode when it is processed with no children nodes. 

3. Fixed a bug for toggling GeometryNode.IsOccluder property. The change didn't take effect before. 

4. Fixed a bug for 3D audio in AR, so now 3D audio in AR environment works.

5. IShader's SetParameters(ICamera camera) interface was not called from the Scene class before, but not it's being
   called.

6. Fixed synchronization problem for adding and removing nodes during scene graph traversal. Now it shouldn't throw
   any exceptions no matter when you add or remove a node from the scene. 

7. If you were using MatrixHelper.ConverToBytes(..) from ConvertFromBytes(..) methods, then if the matrix was
   non-orthographic matrix, it didn't convert correctly because it was decomposing the matrix into scale, translation,
   and rotation for optimization purpose. Now it's been changed to different methods to take care of non-orthographic
   matrices as well (See Changes 13). 

8. Fixed a bug when GeometryNode.Model is unassigned or set to null.

9. Fixed a bug when LightNode is attached to a SwitchNode. It wasn't processed before.

10. Scene.EnableLighting now takes effect (affect the entire scene). It was ignored by mistake before.

11. DefaultTransparencyComparer had wrong sorting order, and it's fixed. Now transparent objects should appear correctly.

12. Fixed a bug in InputMapper class so now it won't throw an exception even if you try to Reenumerate the devices
    while your application is running. 

13. Fixed a bug for displaying the 2nd video image when Scene.MarkerTracker is not set in stereo AR mode.


Changes:

1. Changed the referencing structure. All of the referenced dlls are moved from /bin directory to /dlls direction.
   Managed dlls are in /dlls/managed, and unmanaged dlls are in /dlls/unmanaged. This fixes the problem of Visual
   Studio erasing the necessary dlls from /bin directory when you perform Rebuild or Clean operation.

2. Updated Lidgren.Network to the latest version (gen3 2010-8-27). Updated LidgrenServer and LidgrenClient for this
   update.

3. Removed IPhysicsMaterial interface class since this is specific to Newton based implementations.

4. Moved Newton 1.53 implementations (NewtonPhysics, NewtonMaterial, NewtonJoint, NewtonVehicle, NewtonTire) to
   GoblinXNA.Physics.Newton1 subdirectory from GoblinXNA.Physics.  

5. Removed Scene.ClientPerformSelfPhysicsSimulation property. Now, if the Scene.PhysicsEngine is set in the client
   side, physics simulation will be performed on the client side when networking is used. If you want to synchronize
   the simulation on all networked machines, then do not set Scene.PhysicsEngine property on the client codes. 

6. Moved the networking properties of GeometryNode to SynchronizedGeometryNode class so that the user can
   specify which geometry nodes are synchronized between server and clients in case networking is used. See
   the updated Tutorial 10 for details.

7. Removed NetworkObject class in GoblinXNA.Network directory since these codes are moved to SynchronizedGeometryNode
   class. 

8. Unnecessary bounding box computation is removed, so the application should start faster now if you had huge model.

9. A LightNode only has one LightSource now. There was no point of having multiple LightSources from the beginning, 
   and it was necessary to have only one LightSource for optimizing the code. 

10. PrimitiveMesh class is renamed to CustomeMesh since it makes more sense.

11. Model class has been divided into two classes now, one with mesh loaded from a file (Model.cs), and another with 
   just user defined mesh using CustomMesh class (PrimitiveModel.cs). This change was necessary for optimization 
   and simplification.

12. Line drawings (e.g., bounding box, aabb, collision mesh) are all done by Line3DShader now. When you want to draw 
    a 3D line, make sure to initialize State.LineManager.LineShader as follows: (NOTE: LineRendering.fx is added in 
    data/Shaders)

    State.LineManager.LineShader = new Line3DShader("LineRendering.fx");
    State.LineManager.ShaderTechnique = "LineRendering3D";

13. Due to some internal changes for optimization, you should assign a fresh copy of shader to every model (if it's 
    OK to leave the shader as SimpleEffectShader, then you don't need to do this since it's automatically assigned
    to a fresh copy of SimpleEffectShader for each model by default) if they have different material settings. 

14. IShader's SetParameters(ICamera camera) interface has been changed to SetParameters(CameraNode camera) so that 
    you can get the camera position and direction in the shader as well. 

15. Renamed MatrixHelper.ConverToBytes to MatrixHelper.ConvertToOptimizedBytes, and added 
    MatrixHelper.ConvertToUnoptimizedBytes that actually converts each matrix element into bytes. For the same reason, 
    renamed MatrixHelper.ConvertFromBytes to MatrixHelper.ConvertFromOptimizedBytes, and added 
    MatrixHelper.ConvertFromUnoptimizedBytes.

16: Changed Resolution._1280x960 for IVideoCapture to Resolution._1280x1024 since it is more common. For PointGreyCapture, 
    it is left as 1280x960 even though the enum is 1280x1024.

17. SwitchNode now automatically gets SwitchID assigned to 0 if not assigned when at least one node is added to it.

18. Modified particle systems (ParticleShader.fx) to follow the tracking of the marker if attached to a MarkerNode.


Version 3.4 (4/7/10)


Updates:

1. Inlcuded DShowNET.dll and Lidgren.Network.dll with the distribution, so you only need to download Netwon and
   ALVAR or ARTag library now.

2. Added the GetScale(..) method to NewtonPhysics for getting the scale of a physics object.

3. Added the NetConfig property to LidgrenServer and LidgrenClient classes, so that the user can manually configure
   the networking settings (e.g., max number of connections allowed, max delay).

4. Added support for sensor data acquisition from Vuzix iWear Wrap 920 eyewear. See the updated iWearTracker class for 
   details.

5. Added ALVARWrapper1.3 under the wrappers directory to support the VTT ALVAR 1.3.0 release.

6. Added the NullCapture class under the Device.Capture directory to support static images.

7. Added support to automatically detect whether Vuzix iWear VR920 or Wrap 920 eyewear is plugged in,
   and to enable side-by-side stereo graphics format on the VGA adapter automatically.

8. Added the DetectAdditional property to the ALVARMarkerTracker class.

9. Added Tutorial 14 to demonstrate skinned model animation.

10. Partially finished scene loading and saving functionality. This is a work in progress: It handles simple scenes, 
    but is not yet complete.

11. Added the ability to save an ALVAR multimarker configuration in XML format by using the
    MarkerLayout too: Specify an "xml" file extension when outputting the config file.

12. Added PreTranslation and PostTranslation properties to the TransformNode class. Please see the API documentation 
    for details.


Bug Fixes:

1. Fixed a problem with the physics engine add/removal process for geometry nodes when a SwitchNode is used to switch 
   between different branches.  

2. Fixed a Newton Game Dynamics joint re-addition problem.

3. Fixed a bug in the DefaultTransparencyComparer class.

4. Fixed a bug in single marker detection using the AssociateMarker(int) signature. Now the
   MarkerNode(IMarkerTracker, int) signature will work as expected.

5. Fixed texture mapping and transparent rendering problems for 3D models defined in .fbx and .x files.

6. Fixed the minimum bounding box computation in Model.cs and triangle mesh calculation in
   NewtonPhysics.cs for models with multiple model meshes and parts.

7. Fixed a bug in the MarkerLayout tool. The lines that indicate the marker size are supposed to be status indicator
   in the generated configuration .txt file. 

8. Fixed a problem in assigning WorldTransformation directly to a TransformNode. 

9. Fixed a bug in the TransformNode class for its multiplication ordering. Prior to v3.4, scale and rotation were 
   performed in the wrong order. (This would have caused incorrect behavior only if the x, y, and z scale factors 
   were not identical.) Starting in v3.4, the PreTranslation property was added, and PostTranslation was added as 
   an alias for Translation.


Changes:

1. Modified Tutorial 12 to be able to handle scaling of the vehicle model.

2. Modified Tutorial 13 to support side-by-side stereo for Vuzix iWear Wrap 920 eyewear. 

3. Modified Tutorial 10 in accordance with the network handling code migration (see below).

4. Moved all network handling code in the Scene class to the INetworkHandler implementation. This
   makes it possible for a programmer who does not like how network messages are handled
   in Goblin, to implement their own NetworkHandler to replace the default implementation. 

5. Changed State.IsMultiCore to State.ThreadOption to allow a programmer to specify exactly what operations to 
   multi-thread. 

6. Modified the IVideoCapture interface and its implementations slightly.

7. Removed the StaticImageFile property of the IMarkerTracker interface.

8. Modified Tutorial 8 to include an example of performing tracking on a static image.

9. Removed the MarkerBase class, and migrated all necessary functionality to the Scene class.

10. Renamed PhysicsMaterial to NewtonMaterial, since the material properties apply
    only to the NewtonPhysics implementation.

11. Moved Newton-specific delegates and properties in IPhysicsMaterial to NewtonMaterial.

12. Modified Tutorial 9 to account for the above changes.

13. Removed the Vertices, Mesh, and Transforms properties from IModel interface, and replaced them
    with IPhysicsMeshProvider to provide necessary mesh information for 
    the physics engine to generate triangle meshes. As a result, the Model class now implements IPhysicsMeshProvider,
    and NewtonPhysics uses the properties in this interface to create the triangle mesh. 
    IPhysicsObject now has the new MeshProvider property.

14. Removed the Vector3Helper.GetVertexClouds(...) methods.

15. Modified the DirectShowCapture class, which handles video acquisition, increasing performance by removing
    its middle-layer process. Note: There is still a problem with modifying camera resolution from the default. 
    Use this class with caution!


Version 3.3 (10/15/09)


Updates:

1. Upgraded the underlying XNA framework from 3.0 to 3.1. 

2. Added support for the VTT ALVAR optical marker tracking library. Tutorial 8 now includes an example of using ALVAR.

3. Added an automatic marker array image and configuration generation tool (MarkerLayout) under the tools directory.

4. Added State.DebugTextColor to specify the color of debug text, such as FPS and triangle count.

5. Added the DoneEvent event member to GoblinXNA.Helpers.Interpolator class so that the user can assign functions to be 
   triggered when interpolation finishes. (Note the restriction on usage described in the API doc.)

6. Added support for implementing a custom comparer for sorting the drawing order of transparent geometry. 
   Scene.TransparencyDrawOrderComparer can now be set to a programmer-specified custom comparer.

7. Added 3D text drawing capability using the Nuclex.Fonts library (http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com).
   3D text can now be specified with the GoblinXNA.UI.UI3D.UI3DRenderer Write3DText(...) functions. An
   example is provided in Tutorial 9.  

8. Added the UI2DRenderer.FillPolygon(...) method for polygon drawing. (Note: Concave polygon does not work yet.)

9. Finished the G2DSpinner and G2DList implementations.

10. Added G2DSuggestField, a text field that is capable of showing a suggestion list under the text field.
    This new class is added to the GoblinXNA.UI.UI2D.Fancy package.


Bug Fixes:

1. Fixed the problem that introduced extra lag for marker transformations relative to the displayed video image when 
   State.IsMultiCore is set to true.

2. Fixed the bounding volume computation of models that are not centered at the origin. This problem caused some models
   to be clipped (not rendered) even when they were in the view frustum.

3. Fixed G2DSlider so that is does not function when it is not visible.

4. Fixed the bounds problem for cascaded G2DPanel components.

5. Added focus highlight and null character caret blinking for G2DTextField. Also, fixed the caret position display
   when HorizontalAlignment is set to other than Left.


Improvements:

1. Improved transparency handling.

2. Converted Vector3 calculations to inline in order to increase the computation speed on Update and Draw path
   and methods that are called frequently.

3. Optimized 2D shape and text drawing by deferring the actual drawing until UI2DRenderer.Flush() is called. Programmers
   can now call the UI2DRenderer drawing functions either before or after the base.Draw(..) function.
   (2D drawing functions formerly needed to be called after base.Draw(..)). Now, if 2D drawing functions
   are called after base.Draw(..),
   it will be necessary to call UI2DRenderer.Flush() after all 2D drawing calls to display them on the
   current frame. Otherwise, 2D drawing functions will be deferred until the following frame. However, to draw 2D shapes or
   text on top of 2D UI widgets created using G2D objects, 2D drawing functions must be called after
   base.Draw(..). Otherwise, the 2D drawing primitives will appear beneath the G2D objects.


Changes:

1. Changed the behavior of adding a Node to a BranchNode subclass through AddChild, so that it no longer overrides the Enabled property of the
   added Node to be the same as its parent's Enabled property value.

2. Removed the GoblinXNA.UI.Events package, and converted all listener-based event triggering implementations
   to C# 'event'-based implementations. This change eliminates the neccessity of creating multiple internal classes to
   handle events and the need to create static member variables. Also, it is more intuitive in C# to use
   event properties instead of Java-like listener implementations.

3. Modified the GenericInput class for easier and more intuitive navigation using mouse-dragging.

4. Removed the constant strings in InputMapper and DeviceEnumerator. Please use the Identifier property
   of each InputDevice or InputDevice_6DOF classes to specify the device name (e.g., use 
   MouseInput.Instance.Identifier instead of InputMapper.Mouse to get the mouse device name).


Version 3.2 (4/24/09)


1. Added the ImageFormat enum in the IVideoCapture class that specifies the format of the ImagePtr property, which
   will be passed to the marker tracker library. Added the ImageFormat parameter to the InitVideoCapture(...)
   function. Prior to this change, the format of ImagePtr was always the R8G8B8_24 format, which works for
   ARTag.

2. Removed the audioDeviceID parameter from the IVideoCapture InitVideoCapture(...) function, since it is unlikely
   that anyone will use the audio input that comes with the webcam. Also, as mentioned in the discussion post,
   this put a weird restriction on the resolution of the video device when audio device was used, so it was more
   harmful than useful to have the audioDeviceID parameter.

3. Changed the MarkerNode constructor last parameter type from "params String[]" to "params Object[]".

4. Modified the GenericInput, KeyboardInput, MouseInput, GPS, InterSense, and InputMapper classes so that they are now singleton 
   Classes. The Instance property should now be used to access their instantiations. 

5. Fixed a problem with Tutorial 11, and modified Tutorial 8 to match changes 1 and 2 listed above.

6. Added a "tools" folder, and included in it the SceneGraphDisplay visual debugging tool. 

7. Modified the InputMapper class so that it no longer automatically initializes the GPS and InterSense classes.
   Programmers that want to use either the GPS or InterSense classes will need to create instances of
   these classes, initialize them, and add them to the InputMapper class through the 
   InputMapper.AddInputDevice(...) or InputMapper.Add6DOFInputDevice(...) functions. After adding them,
   it is necessary to call the InputMapper.Reenumerate() function. 

8. Due to the changes listed above (#7), it will no longer be necessary to have the
   InterSenseEnable, InterSenseHost, or InterSensePort setting
   variables in the setting file to use an InterSense tracker. Instead,  these parameters host name and port number)
   Should be passed to the InterSense constructor to connect to it through the network server.

9. Added support for Vuzix iWear VR920 eyewear (a stereoscopic head-worn display with built-in orientation tracking). 
   The classes are in the GoblinXNA.Device.iWear package.

10. Removed the InputDeviceDriver class, since it is no longer used.

11. Fixed nondeterministic behavior caused when adding nodes to the scene graph while the scene
    graph is being traversed.

12. Added the GetClosestPoint(..) method to NewtonPhysics.

13. Added additional placement options for the Notifier class to support a custom starting location and transition direction. 
   
14. Modified the IMarkerTracker interface to require the ZNearPlane and ZFarPlane properties.

15. Added tutorial 13 to demonstrate the Vuzix iWear VR920 eyewear stereo mode.

16. Added LeftEyeVideoID, RightEyeVideoID, LeftEyeVideoImageShift, and RightEyeVideoImageShift properties 
    to the Scene class to support stereo video overlay.

17. Added the VideoVisibleArea property to the Scene class to support modifying the visible area of the
    video image rendered on the background. By default, it renders the entire video image when
    ShowCameraImage is set to true.

18. Fixed re-addition of Newton joints when RestartSimulation() is called in NewtonPhysics. 



Version 3.1 (2/18/09)


1. Added Tutorial 12 to demonstrate advanced physics functionality, including joint
   physics and vehicle physics simulation.


2. Made significant structural and design changes for video capturing and marker tracking for better
   flexibility and extensibility.

   a) Moved Point Grey (PGRFly)-related classes under the GoblinXNA.Device.Capture.PointGrey package.

   b) Moved marker tracking-related utility classes from GoblinXNA.Device.Vision.Util to
      GoblinXNA.Device.Util.

   c) Removed the VideoCapture class. Instead, added the IVideoCapture interface so that each 
      video streaming class is implemented in its own class that extends the new IVideoCapture interface
      (e.g., DirectShowCapture and PointGreyCapture). Now, a programmer can create their own video streaming
      class that uses another video streaming library, simply by implementing the IVideoCapture interface. 
      It would then be added to the Scene class to be used either for marker tracking or for displaying 
      the video image on the background. Prior to this change, it was necessary to modify the VideoCapture class
      inside Goblin XNA and recompile the library to create a new streaming class. 
      Now, a new streaming class can be implemented outside of Goblin XNA, eliminating the need to modify and recompile 
      Goblin XNA. 

   d) Removed the MarkerTracker class and added the IMarkerTracker interface. The ARTagTracker class
      implements this interface using the ARTag library. To support a different marker tracking
      class using another tracker library, implement this interface and assign the tracker implementation
      to Scene.MarkerTracker. 


3. Made signification modifications to the Scene class due to the redesign:

   a) Removed the Scene.InitMarkerModules(...) function.

   b) Replaced the Scene.InitVideoCapture(...) function with the Scene.AddVideoCapture(...) function. The
      signature of the function has changed, so please see the API documentation, as well as Tutorial 8,
      for details. Before adding a video capture device, it will be necessary to initialize the
      device by calling the InitVideoCapture(...) function with appropriate parameters.

   c) Replaced the Scene.InitMarkerTracker(...) function with the Scene.MarkerTracker property. It is now possible to
      directly set the desired IMarkerTracker implementation to Scene.MarkerTracker. The
      marker tracker must be initialized before being set.

   d) Added the Scene.TrackerVideoID property, which is used to specify which capture device to use for
      performing tracking when there is more than one video capture device. Previously,
      Scene.OverlayVideoID was used to specify which capture device to use, but now they are separated.
      As a result, a different video overlay image can be shown on the background than the video image
      used for tracking. For example, this is useful when one camera is used only for 
      tracking hand gestures (with markers attached to the fingers or hand), and a separate camera is used
      to visualize the physical world. 

   e) Added the Scene.FreezeVideo property, which can be used to freeze video streaming. (Note that when the
      video image is frozen, the virtual world is not frozen.)


4. Modified the MarkerNode constructor signature, and added new properties:

   a) Removed the arTagArrayName parameter due to changes to the MarkerTracker class, since the
      marker tracking library may not be ARTag. Replaced this with the markerConfigs parameter,
      which is an array of String that can specify the marker configuration for any marker
      tracker library. 

   b) Removed the smoothingAlpha parameter and replaced it with the Smoother property, which can be set to
      any implementation of the ISmoother interface. This way, the programmer has the choice of what smoothing
      algorithm to apply instead of being forced to use the DES (double-exponential-smoothing) implementation.

   c) Added the Predictor property, which can be set to any implementation of the IPredictor interface. This 
      predictor is used to predict the marker transform when the marker is not found in the image
      for a few frames.


5. Added the UserData property to the Node class (the ancestor of all Node types). Since UserData is an Object
   type, it makes it possible for any type of information to be associated with a Node. 


6. Added Smoother and Predictor properties to TrackerNode.


7. Added AddInputDevice(..), Add6DOFInputDevice(..), and Reenumerate() functions to the InputMapper class.
   This makes it possible to add a new implemented InputDevice or InputDevice_6DOF class to the
   InputMapper, and use it with the TrackerNode. After adding a new device to InputMapper,
   it will be necessary to call Reenumerate() so that the newly added device is recognized.
