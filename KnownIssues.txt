Augmented reality related:

1. Video image flickers occasionally for some reason. 

2. DirectShowCapture can't change the camera resolution from its default one under x86 compilation
   environment. There is something wrong with DirectShow for modifying the resolution under x86.


Physics engine related:

1. When shape type is Cylinder type (or any similar types), if they are not interactable (static)
   then their collision model is, for some reason, not rotated even if the actual model has rotation.

2. If a physics object is set to be ShapeType.TriangleMesh, it can be penetrated from time to time even
   if the object is 'thick' enough. This is probably due to Newton 1.5.3 bug, and maybe fixed in their 
   2.0 releases. 

3. Changing Enabled property of a geometry node does not add/remove the geometry node to/from physics 
   simulation, so you need to add/remove the geometry node to/from physics engine in your code when you
   modify the Enabled property of a geometry node. We cannot automate this process because if Enabled is
   set to false, then the node or its children are not traversed, so we cannot automatically figure out
   when to add/remove.


Miscellaneous:

1. KeyboardInput's type event needs to be fixed for key type repetition capability.

2. The focus event handling in the 2D UI is not complete, so it won't work automatically. You will need to set
   the focus properties manually. This property doesn't matter for most UIs except UIs that use editable 
   G2DTextField (e.g., G2DSuggestField). 

3. Shadow mapping may not work properly (has artifacts) with Intel graphics cards.
