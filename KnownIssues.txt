Augmented reality related:

1. Video image flickers occasionally for some reason. 

2. Stereo video image mode freezes some time.

3. DESSmoother has problem smoothing out rotation, so you may want to use it only for smoothing out 
   translation until it is fixed. 


Physics engine related:

1. When shape type is Cylinder type (or any similar types), if they are not interactable (static)
   then their collision model is, for some reason, not rotated even if the actual model has rotation.

2. If a physics object is set to be ShapeType.TriangleMesh, it can be penetrated from time to time even
   if the object is 'thick' enough. This is probably due to Newton 1.5.3 bug, and maybe fixed in their 
   2.0 releases. 


Miscellaneous:

1. KeyboardInput's type event needs to be fixed for key type repetition capability.

2. The focus event handling in the 2D UI is not complete, so it won't work automatically. You will need to set
   the focus properties manually. This property doesn't matter for most UIs except UIs that use editable 
   G2DTextField (e.g., G2DSuggestField). 

3. Shadow mapping may not work properly (has artifacts) with Intel graphics cards.
